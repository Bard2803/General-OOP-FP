Simulation of bacteria replication with and without antibiotics

Introduction In this problem set, you will design and implement a stochastic simulation of bacteria population dynamics, 
and reach conclusions about how various treatment regimens affect the spread of the bacteria based on the simulation results.

Background: Bacteria, Antibiotics, and Computational Models Bacteria are single-celled organisms that reproduce asexually.
Some bacteria cause diseases, some are harmless, and some are beneficial. Bad bacteria can cause infections such as strep throat
and tuberculosis. Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics targeted to kill only the bad bacterial cells. Bacteria that 
cause infections can resist and develop a resilience to antibiotics in two ways: (1) naturally and (2) via inappropriate use of antibiotics. 
Thus, populations of bacteria can undergo substantial evolutionary changes within a single patient over the course of treatment. 
In this problem set, we will make use of simulations to explore the effect of introducing antibiotics to the bacteria population
and determine how best to address these treatment challenges within a simplified model. We will implement a highly simplified 
stochastic model of bacteria population dynamics within a person. Nevertheless, our model exhibits biologically relevant
